Project Description:
  Sneak Peek is a secure, e-commerce website application that allows buyers to purchase shoes from authorized sellers. The website has a shopping cart for buyers, and 
  allows buyers to search from a wide range of products. A product's information can be easily compared with other products' information to give the buyer all the info 
  they need to make the best purchase. Sellers can apply for a seller account, and once approved, can sell their products through Sneak Peek. Sneak Peek also has a built in 
  option that gives the seller the ability to withdraw their profits accumulated without the hassle of other more constricting payment methods. This application is a project
  for the Introduction to Software Engineering course at Mississippi State University, and is not an actual, commercial application. 

Project objective:
  This project is intended to show how a user can have the ability to access a website and choose from multiple different products that are sold by authorized sellers. This application
  is intended to give buyers the ability to securely purchase shoes in a convenient way, and to give sellers the ability to sell their own authorized products and have easy access to their 
  own profits. This project is also a demonstration of the full-stack development principles and methods of practice. This application, although fairly small scale, can represent an actual website
  application that could exist due to its functionalities.

Project features:
  This project was created using html, css, and javascript for front-end design, and python with SQLite DB for back-end/server-side design. (NEED TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE MAKE
  JUMP FROM HTML DOC TO ACTUAL WEBSITE). The project also has a core design that utilizes three different types of user classes, the Buyer, the Seller, and the Admin. The buyer can create an account,
  login, search for products, compare products to each other, add products to their cart, edit their cart, checkout their cart, and return products. The seller can create an account, login, add their products
  for sale, receive payments that can be transferred to their bank, and even edit or add more products to their inventory. The admin has the ability to approve or deny new user accounts, and is also responsible
  for overseeing different buyer and seller activities as well as having access to personal information.
